Note: From this point onwards, whenever you create a new program, or modify an existing program in the folder my_ruby_programs, open a Bash shell in that folder and type:

# (from shell:)
git add .
git commit -a -m "a note about your commit"
git push

The GitHub repository will show you the latest files that you have uploaded.
